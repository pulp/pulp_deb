The ``pulp_deb`` Plugin
================================================================================

.. include:: external_references.rst

The ``pulp_deb`` plugin extends the `pulpcore python package`_ with the ability to host deb packages within APT repositories.
This plugin is a part of the `Pulp Project`_, and assumes some familiarity with the `pulpcore documentation`_.

If you are just getting started, we recommend getting to know the :doc:`basic workflows <workflows>`.

See the `pulp_deb REST API`_ documentation for the full feature set of the ``pulp_deb`` plugin.
