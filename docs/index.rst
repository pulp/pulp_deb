pulp-deb Plugin
===============

The ``deb`` plugin extends `pulpcore <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pulpcore/>`__ to support
hosting deb packages. This plugin is a part of the `Pulp Project
<http://www.pulpproject.org>`_, and assumes some familiarity with the `pulpcore documentation
<https://docs.pulpproject.org/en/3.0/nightly/>`_.

If you are just getting started, we recommend getting to know the :doc:`basic
workflows<workflows/index>`.

The REST API documentation for ``pulp_deb`` is available `here <restapi.html>`_.
