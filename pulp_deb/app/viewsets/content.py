class ContentRelationshipFilter(Filter):
    """
    Base class for filters that allow you to ask meaningful questions about the relationships of
    deb-specific content types. Subclasses must provide a HELP message and implement _filter.

    The value for all these filters is a string that is a comma-separated 2-tuple, where the second
    value is the HREF of the RepositoryVersion you care about. This is logically necessary if you
    want to ask any question beyond "list Package|ReleaseComponent|whatever that were ever at any
    point in this Repository|Release|whatever". I will try to explain by example.

    Question: "What Packages are in the most recent RepositoryVersion of a Release?"

    Imagine we have a very simple repo with two packages and two releases, and this state is stored
    in RepositoryVersion1:
    Repository -> Release1 -> ReleaseComponent1 -> PackageReleaseComponent1 -> Package1
                                                -> PackageReleaseComponent2 -> Package2
               -> Release2 -> ReleaseComponent2 -> PackageReleaseComponent3 -> Package2

    We then update the repo to remove Package2 from ReleaseComponent1 and this state gets stored
    in RepositoryVersion2:
    Repository -> Release1 -> ReleaseComponent1 -> PackageReleaseComponent1 -> Package1
               -> Release2 -> ReleaseComponent2 -> PackageReleaseComponent3 -> Package2

    We could try answer the question using the existing ContentFilter.repository_version filter in
    conjunction with a new filter that naively follows the foreign key references in the database:
    packages.filter(deb_packagereleasecomponent__release_component__release=release_uuid)

    What Django does if you call two separate filters is use the first to filter the QuerySet,
    then use the second to filter the QuerySet further. This is *different* than calling
    filter once with both conditions.
    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/queries/#spanning-multi-valued-relationships

    Example: packages.filter("in RepositoryVersion2").filter("in Release1")
    This will return both Package1 and Package2, which is not what we wanted. In the first filter it
    looks and says "yep, both Package1 and Package2 are in RepositoryVersion2", and then the second
    filter is applied and it says "yep, both Package1 and Package2 were in Release1 at some point".
    This is because the linkage via PackageReleaseComponent2 still *exists*, it's just not in
    RepositoryVersion2.

    What we really _actually_ want is to apply _both_ conditions to the PackageReleaseComponent
    mapping as an intermediate step, so both release_uuid and repository_version_href must be
    passed to our new filter:
    packages.filter(package.PRC in PRC.filter("in RepositoryVersion2", "in Release1"))

    This guarantees that we are only considering Packages with both requirements, and returns only
    Package1.
